{"name":"Aspidites","tagline":"IPython turtle functionality. ","body":"Over the past 2 months Nathan, Nic and Jake of the Aspidites team have been working on IPython as a project for a 3rd year Computer Science course. Our goal was to add turtle functionality to IPython using an HTML canvas and Paper.js. We were able to meet our goal within the semester and we're quite happy with the result. There are some bugs and there's plenty of room for new features, but, we think it came out pretty nicely in the end so we would like to share it with you guys. Below you will find a link to our GitHub repository. Once you clone it to start it up just run \"python -m IPython notebook\" from the command line in the aspidites directory. Then start a new notebook with the following lines and you'll see our turtle.\r\n\r\nfrom NewTurtle import Turtle\r\nt = Turtle()\r\nt.forward(100)\r\n\r\nSome of the other turtle commands we have are:\r\n\r\nbackward()\r\nright()\r\nleft()\r\ncircle()\r\npenup()\r\npendown()\r\nspeed()\r\npencolor()","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
